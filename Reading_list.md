## General reading list

1. VanderPlas, ["Python data science handbook"](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/), O'Reilly, 2017, ISBN 9781491912058 ([Code on Github](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook))
   1. Comment: This book covers a wide range of topics relating to data analysis and machine learning using Python. The content of this book is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) in the form of Jupyter notebooks.
2. Deeplearning.AI on Coursera, ["Machine learning specialization"](https://gb.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction#courses).
   1. Comment: this specialisation is friendly o beginners in machine learning, and will teach the fundamentals of machine learning and how to use these techniques to build real-world AI applications. Note that it is not free after 7-day trials.
3. Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville, ["Deep learning"](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/), MIT Press, 2016, ISBN 9780262035613
   1. Comment: this online book is written by big names in machine learning and is frequently updated. It is quite extensive and covers many topics in deep learning. This book comes with lecture notes and exercises. 



## Week 5 reading list

- [Understanding the Bias-Variance tradeoff](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html): a good introduction on the bias-variance tradeoff. It also provides a demonstration of bias and variance using k-nearest-neighbour algorithm for predicting voters' party.
- [Gentle Introduction to the Bias-Variance Trade-Off in Machine Learning](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-to-the-bias-variance-trade-off-in-machine-learning/): another introduction on the topic of bias-variance trade-off. A bit heavier than the previous one. 
- [Data leakage in machine learning](https://machinelearningmastery.com/data-leakage-machine-learning/): good introduction of data leakage in machine learning, with examples and tips to combat data leakage.
- [Chapter 11 Practical Methodology](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/guidelines.html), Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville, ["Deep learning"](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/), MIT Press, 2016, ISBN 9780262035613. This chapter gives practical guidance on improving a machine learning model.
